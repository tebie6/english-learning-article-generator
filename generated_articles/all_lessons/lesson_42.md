**Title:** A Day in the Life of a Handyman

Imagine being a handyman who loves to work with his hands, fixing things around the house, and creating something from scratch. That's exactly what our friend John did. He started painting the wall of his living room by himself (by yourself) because he wanted it to match the beautiful sunset colors he saw every evening before sunset.

To paint the entire wall, John took a few days, but finally, he finished painting the wall in one day! His friends were impressed with how quickly and beautifully he painted the wall. They even asked him if he could help them fix their broken window (breaking the window) with a stone that had caused it to break.

John agreed and said, "Don't worry, I'll finish fixing the window today." And indeed, he did. John's friends were grateful for his help and promised to repay him someday. John just smiled and said, "No need, I'm happy to help." He then went on to clean the house (cleaning the house) from top to bottom because he wanted everything to be spotless before having dinner.

After dinner, John decided to take a break and read a book in one night! It was a nice way to relax after a long day of work. The next morning, John's friends came over and asked him if he had finished reading the book yet. He replied, "No, I'm still on chapter three!" They laughed and said, "We'll wait for you to finish reading it before we come back."

**标题:**一天中的工匠生活

想象一下，你是位爱上手工作，修理家中事物，而又能从零开始创造东西的工匠。这就是我们的朋友约翰做的事情。他决定独自一人对着他的客厅墙壁进行粉刷，因为他想要让粉刷好的颜色与每天傍晚时分所看到的美丽的日落颜色相匹配。

为了将整面的墙壁都粉刷好，约翰花了几天时间，但最终，他却只用了一天就将整个墙壁给粉刷好了！他的朋友对他如此快速且又精细地完成粉刷工作感到印象深刻，还问他能不能也来帮忙修理一下他们的碎裂玻璃窗户（因为石头把它打破了）。

约翰答应并说：“别担心，我今天一定会将其修好。”果然，他也只用了一天就将玻璃窗户给修好。约翰的朋友们对他的帮助感到感激，并且暗示着他在不久之后一定会有机会回报他们。约翰只是笑了笑，回答说：“谢谢你们，但我一点都不需要回报，因为我很高兴能为你们做点什么。”然后，他便决定将屋子从顶到下彻底打扫一下，因为他想要在吃晚餐之前，将屋子所有的地方都变得干净无尘。

吃完晚饭之后，约翰决定暂时放弃工作，让自己好好休息一天，他选择晚上阅读一本书作为他的休息方式。第二天早上，约翰的朋友们过来问他是否已经将这本书读完了。他回答说：“还没有，我现在才刚刚读到第三章。”他们看到他这么兴奋，就笑着说：“我们会等你把这本书读完再回来看你的。”
