**English Article**

As I finished reading the book in one night, I felt a sense of accomplishment. The next morning, after washing the dishes, I decided to paint the wall with my friends before sunset. We worked together efficiently and completed the project on time. However, they denied that they were planning to escape from prison by digging a tunnel. It was surprising, but we couldn't deny the fact that it was at the last minute when they changed their mind.
