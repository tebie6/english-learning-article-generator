**English Article**

As you grow older, there are certain things that change. Some of these changes include the freedom to go out at night with your parents' permission. When you become an adult, you can go out at night alone without needing anyone's approval. However, this newfound independence also comes with new responsibilities.

One of the most significant changes is the ability to drive a car. To do this, you need to have a driver's license, which requires passing a driving test and following certain rules on the road. Once you get your license, it's not just about the thrill of driving; it's also about taking care of yourself and others on the road.

It's good for friends to drive with a driver's license, as this shows that they are responsible and can take care of themselves while driving. However, it's equally important to remember that driving without a license is not only against the law but also extremely dangerous.

In conclusion, growing older brings many changes, including increased freedom and new responsibilities. As you navigate these changes, always prioritize your safety and the safety of those around you.

**Chinese Translations**

随着年龄的增长，会发生一些变化。其中一些变化包括在得到父母同意后可以夜晚外出。成年人可以一个人到夜晚外出，不需要别人的许可。但是，这种新的独立也带来了新的责任。

最显著的变化之一就是开车。要做到这一点，需要有驾照，它需要通过驾驶考试并遵守道路上的某些规则。一旦你获得了你的驾照，它不是关于驾驶的乐趣；它也是关于在路上照顾自己和他人的责任。

好友们可以一起开车，因为这表明他们负责且能在驾驶时自我保管。然而，也要记住，未经许可就开车不仅违法，而且极其危险。

综上所述，年龄的增长带来了许多变化，包括增大的自由和新的责任。在这些变化中，请优先考虑你的安全和周围那些人的安全。
