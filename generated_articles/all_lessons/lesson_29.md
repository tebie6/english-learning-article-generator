**Going Out with Parents**

As a responsible parent, you might worry about your child going out at night without supervision. However, if they are old enough to go out with friends, you may feel more comfortable letting them go on their own. For instance, if your child has an adult friend or an old friend who is also old enough to drive, you can consider allowing them to go out together.

In many places, having a driver's license is required for driving, so it's essential to check with the authorities in your area about the rules and regulations regarding underage drivers. If your child is not yet old enough to drive, they may need to rely on friends who are licensed or use public transportation. As a parent, it's crucial to teach your child about responsibility and decision-making skills.

If you're planning a night out with friends and family, make sure to discuss the plans in advance and agree on what's acceptable behavior while going out at home, school, or elsewhere. Remember, being old enough doesn't necessarily mean someone is mature enough for certain situations.

**与父母出行**

作为负责任的父母，你可能会担心孩子夜间不受监管地出行。但是，如果他们已经足够大可以与朋友出去玩，你可能会更舒服地让他们自己去。但是，如果你的孩子有成年朋友或老朋友也是足够大的，可以开车，你可能会考虑允许他们一起出去。

在很多地方，驾照需要满18岁，所以你需要检查当地的法律规定。如果你的孩子尚未到达驾照年龄，他们可能需要依靠已具备驾照的朋友，或使用公共交通。作为父母，你必须教导孩子责任感和决策能力。

如果你打算与朋友和家人夜出，你一定要提前商量并同意行为准则。这一点对于在家、学校或其他地方都重要。有时，年龄大并不意味着某人已经成熟足够应对特定情况。
