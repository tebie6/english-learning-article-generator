**English Article**

As a teacher, I have been working in this neighborhood for five years. Since then, I have seen many changes. Some of the new students who moved here last year are still struggling to pay their bills on time. One of them is my friend's daughter. She was married two years ago and has been living with her husband since then. However, she recently got sick and had to take a break from work.

I have been trying to help her catch up on her assignments while she recovers. Her husband is very supportive, but he is also struggling to find a job in this economy. As a teacher, it's heartbreaking to see students facing such challenges. But I am here to support them and help them get back on track.
