### English Article

As I was preparing for my exam, I realized that I needed to study harder. To help me improve, my teacher suggested that I use the dictionary more often. I had to use it to look up unfamiliar words and phrases. However, I didn't have to use it every time, as my memory was still sharp enough to recall some of the vocabulary.

One day, I wanted to give my friend some advice on how to improve his English skills. I told him that he should practice speaking with native speakers and listen to podcasts or audiobooks regularly. I also suggested that he join an online community where students can discuss grammar and vocabulary topics. He seemed interested in my suggestions, so I hope he will take them seriously.

In addition to studying, I need to use the phone to contact my teacher for further guidance. Sometimes, I just need to use the bathroom, but it's not always convenient. My friend's bathroom is just next door, and sometimes we'll both need to use it at the same time. Anyway, I hope you find these suggestions helpful.

### 中文翻译

当我准备考试时，我意识到自己必须更加努力地学习。为了帮助我提高，我的老师建议我更经常使用字典。虽然我不总是需要用它查找未知词语和短语，但我的记忆力还是足够好可以回想起一些词汇。

有一天，我想要给朋友一些关于如何提高英语技能的建议。我告诉他，他应该经常跟native speaker聊天，听过podcasts或audiobooks。也建议他加入一个在线社区，这里学生可以讨论语法和词汇相关话题。他似乎对我的建议感兴趣，所以希望他能够认真地采纳。

除了学习之外，我需要使用电话与老师联系寻求进一步的指导。有时，我只是需要去洗手间，但不是总是方便。我朋友的洗手间就在隔壁，有时我们都会在同一时间需要用它。在任何情况下，我希望这些建议会对你有所帮助。
