**Inviting Friends to Join Your Party**

Last weekend, we wanted to invite her to join the party. But she didn't want to join us. We really wanted to invite her to join the party because she was our best friend. However, she refused to join the party because she didn't have enough time.

As a responsible person, I decided not to push her to change her mind. Instead, I told her that we would plan another party soon and invited her to join us then. She accepted the invitation with gratitude.

In preparation for our next gathering, I learned how to drive so that I could pick up some guests from the airport. I really wanted to learn how to drive because it's essential to have a driver's license in case of emergencies. To get a driver's license, you need to pass a written test and a driving test.

After finishing my work on time, I watched a movie with friends during our free time. It was a great way to relax and enjoy each other's company. If we had more time, we would have invited her to join us and finish watching the movie together. But for now, we just finished our work and enjoyed some quality time.

### 中文翻译
**邀请朋友参加你的聚会**

上周末，我们想邀请她加入我们的聚会。但是，她不愿意参加。我们很想要邀请她参加聚会，因为她是我们的好朋友。但是，她拒绝参加因为她没有足够的时间。

作为一个负责任的人，我决定不去强迫她改变她的决定。相反，我告诉她我们将计划另一个聚会，并邀请她参加。如果她能来，我们会一起做很多有趣的事情。

为了准备我们的下一次聚会，我学习了如何开车，以便我可以接送一些朋友从机场。因为如果你能够开车，说明你更有能力应对各种情况。如果你想获得驾照，你需要通过一份书面测试和驾驶测试。

上班后，我有空时间就和朋友一起看电影。这是一个放松身心并享受彼此公司的好方法。如果我们再多时间，我们会邀请她参加聚会，完成看完这部电影。但是现在，我们只完成了工作，并且度过了一些高质量的时间。
