## English Article

The party was supposed to start at 6 pm, but we didn't invite her to join us. Yesterday, we didn't want to invite her to join the party yesterday, but she really wanted to join us. However, because she didn't have enough time, she refused to join the party. But if she had accepted the responsibility and got a driver's license, she could have driven us to the party. Unfortunately, she didn't finish my work on time, so I couldn't attend the party with her. If only we had more time, things would be different.
