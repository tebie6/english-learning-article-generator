### English Article
**Deciding on Dinner Plans**

It's been a long day, and I'm thinking about dinner. My friend suggested we go out for dinner tonight, but I decided to drive the car myself yesterday. I didn't have to change my mind, but I wanted to try something new. We don't need to believe that driving is always safe; sometimes you just have to take a chance.

We decided to go out for dinner, but first, we need to find a way to stop our friend from paying the bill. Yesterday, he paid him ten dollars to do it, but tonight, we want to decide who gets to pay. I changed my mind again and said we should try to stop him from paying at all.

As we were discussing this, someone asked us the same question: "Who pays for dinner?" But nobody answered, so we had to ask them again. Finally, after a long conversation, we decided to go out for dinner, but this time, I drove the car. It was a great night out, and we all enjoyed it.

In conclusion, deciding on dinner plans can be tough, but sometimes you just have to take a chance and try something new.

### 中文翻译
**决定今晚的晚餐**

今天是一天了，我在想今晚要吃什么。我的朋友建议我们今晚出去吃晚餐，但昨天我自己开车，所以不需要改变主意，但我想要尝试新鲜的事儿。

我们决定去外面吃晚餐，但是我们先得找出如何阻止朋友付账。昨天，他给了他十美元让我来付费，但是今天我们要决定谁来付钱。我又改主意了，说我们应该尽量不让他付费。

当我们讨论这个问题时，有个人问我们同样的问题："晚餐费用谁来付？" 但是没人回答，所以我们就继续问。最终，在长时间的讨论后，我们决定去外面吃晚餐，但这次我开车。今天夜晚非常美好，大家都很高兴。

总之，决定今晚的晚餐可以很困难，但是有时你只需要冒险尝试新鲜的事儿。
