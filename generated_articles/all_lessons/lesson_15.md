**English Article**

As I walked into the restaurant, I decided to go out for dinner. We had been deciding all day, but we finally decided to go out at 7 pm. The bill was a bit pricey, so I asked him if he wanted me to pay the bill or just split it. He said that would be fine, and we decided to split it. However, when the waiter came over with the check, my friend suddenly decided not to pay his share, saying he didn't have enough money. I was surprised and tried to change his mind, but he insisted. So, in the end, I had to find a way to stop him from leaving without paying his part of the bill.
