Suddenly, one of them exclaimed, "I told you, it's all about keeping a good balance between work and life!" I smiled, remembering the promise I made earlier. My friend's words resonated with me, as I too was struggling to keep a balance between my responsibilities and personal life.

当我坐在河边，观察朋友钓鱼时，我向自己许下了一份承诺：每天都要学好英语。朋友轻声告诉我：“你钓鱼时需要保持沉默。”我点了点头表示同意，并继续观察他们的技巧。

突然，一个朋友大声地说：“我告诉过你，这是关于把工作和生活之间的平衡做好！”我微笑着回忆起我之前许下的承诺。我的朋友的话让我感到耳熟，因为我也曾经为在职责和个人生活之间取得平衡而努力。

如今，我仍会保持沉默，但我感激我的朋友分享了这个秘密建议。它使我意识到即使是在困难的时候，我们也能通过坚持自己的优先事项来找到宁静。每当我面临着一个挑战性的情况时，我都会回忆起这些智慧的话： “把工作和生活之间的平衡做好。”
