**English Article**

As I was getting home, I realized I had forgotten to lock the door. "Oh no!" I thought, "I'll have to go back and do it now." But then I remembered that my friend would be coming over soon, so I decided to tell her to remind me when she got here. We sat down to eat some dinner together, and as we were finishing up, I reminded myself to pay the electricity bill on time. After we had eaten, we started doing some housework, making sure everything was tidy before my friend left.
