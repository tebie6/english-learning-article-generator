**English Article**

As I plan to travel the world next year, I've been thinking about who I'd like to join me on this adventure. My friend Xingrong has always been interested in exploring new places, and I think she would love to stay here with me while we travel. However, she plans to leave the city next week, so it's not possible for her to accompany us on our trip.

Instead, I've decided to pay the bill for my family to join me on this journey. It's very important that they feel included in this experience, and I'm excited to share it with them. We plan to stay here as early as possible and make the most of our time together. Who knows? Maybe one day we'll even travel to every country in the world!

**Chinese Translations**

当我打算下年去世界旅游的时候，我就开始思考谁会陪同我一起进行这次冒险。我的朋友邢荣一直对探索新地方感兴趣，我想她一定会喜欢在此地与我们共同度过旅程。但是，她计划于下周离开城市，所以她无法与我们一起出行。

相反，我决定付钱，让家人加入我在这次旅行中。它非常重要，确保他们感觉被包含在这个体验之中，而且我兴奋于与他们共享。这次我们的时间短暂，我们打算尽早出发并充分利用每一分钟。不知道呢？也许有一天我们甚至会前往世界上的每一个国家！
