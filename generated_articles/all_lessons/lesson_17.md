### English Article


It's our team's decision to join the competition. We've been preparing for this moment and are excited to show off our skills.

Last week, we invited our friends from another school to join us, but they decided not to participate. Instead, they asked if they could watch us perform during their recess time.

The gift we received from our sponsors was a huge morale booster, and it made us even more determined to finish strong. However, some of the team members were worried that they wouldn't be able to finish their homework on time because of all the extra practice sessions.

But I know I can count on my teammates to help me out. We've been working together for so long now that we can watch each other's backs and make sure everything gets done. If anyone needs some extra help, we're always there to lend a hand.

And if someone wants to answer the questions from our coaches or refuses to listen to their advice, that's okay too! We just need to remember why we started this team in the first place – because it was fun and we wanted to challenge ourselves.

So here's to another great season, and I'm confident that with teamwork and determination, we'll be able to overcome any obstacles and finish strong!

我们决定要加入比赛，已经为这个目的准备了很长时间。上周，我们邀请来自另一所学校的朋友加入我们的队伍，但他们决定不参加比赛。相反，他们问是否可以在他们放学的时候观赏我们的表演。

我们从赞助商那里收到的礼物让我们精神振奋，而且更加决心地完成强制。这时，某些团队成员担心自己不能在额外的练习时间中完成家庭作业。然而，我知道我可以相信我的同事，他们会帮助我。如果有人需要额外的帮助，我们总是愿意伸出援手。

如果有人想要回答我们的教练提出的问题或者拒绝听从他们的建议，那也没关系！我们只需记住为什么我们成立这个团队的初衷—因为它很有趣，并且我们想挑战自己。

所以，让我们再度期待着另一个伟大的赛季，相信通过团结和决心，我们一定能克服任何困难并取得成功！
