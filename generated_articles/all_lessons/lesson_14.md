**English Article**

As I look back on my life, I realize that when I was young, I wanted to eat an apple every day. In fact, I even went so far as to tell myself that I would eat one every morning without fail. But, alas, I didn't always succeed in keeping this promise to myself.

I remember the time when I lost my job two years ago and felt like I was washed away by my troubles. It was a difficult period, but I managed to find comfort in knowing that I had bought some time to think about what I wanted to do next.

Speaking of which, have you ever tried calling someone after they've left their office? Well, I did just that last night and was surprised when he told me that he had already bought a house. It was like a punch to the gut - I felt like I'd been forgotten in my own life.

Anyway, it's funny how we can get caught up in our own thoughts and forget what's truly important. But sometimes, all it takes is a friendly reminder from someone who understands us to make us see things in a different light.

So, if you ever find yourself feeling lost or unsure of what to do next, just remember that you're not alone. There are people out there who want to help and support you every step of the way.
