### English Article

As I got ready to leave the house, my mother reminded me to lock the door and not forget to do the housework when I'm out. I promised her that I would use my time wisely and complete all the tasks before nightfall. She also asked me to show her how to use the dictionary she bought for our trip next week.

I wanted to teach her something important, but she politely declined, saying that she didn't want to learn anything new today. Feeling a bit frustrated, I decided to let my curiosity get the better of me and ask my father to join us on this adventure. He agreed, and we set off towards our destination, eager to explore and learn.

When we arrived, I couldn't wait to use the dictionary to translate some words written in an unfamiliar language. My father smiled and said that he was proud of me for remembering to bring it along. As we sat down to rest and discuss our plan, my mother walked in with a worried look on her face. "Don't forget to lock the door when you leave," she called out, reminding us one last time.

### 中文翻译

为了离开家，我母亲提醒我锁上门并在外面不要忘记做家务。 我答应她会利用时间合理地完成所有任务之前下班。 她也请我展示一下如何使用最近买的词典。

我想教她一些重要的事，但她礼貌地拒绝了，说今天不想学新的东西。感到有点烦躁，我决定让我的好奇心高兴，问父亲是否能一起出发。他同意了，我们去我们的目的地，迫切地想要探索和学习。

当我们到达时，我无法等待使用词典来翻译一些用一种陌生语言写的单词。 我父亲微笑着说他很自豪我记住带上它。 当我们坐下来休息讨论计划时，我的母亲走进来了，她脸上的表情有些担忧。“不要忘记锁门”她叫出最后一次。
