**English Article**

As a teacher, I always want to notice the differences between my students. Yesterday, I was teaching our children how to tell the difference between right and wrong. I noticed that some of them were old enough to understand the concept, but others needed more time to learn.

When I asked them questions about what is right or wrong, some replied correctly, while others said something different from what I expected. That's when it struck me - there is a big difference between our children and us adults in terms of understanding morality. It made me realize that we need to teach them how to tell the difference between right and wrong.

So, today, I decided to use an old tool, a diagram, to help them understand the concept better. After explaining it to them, I asked them to draw their own diagrams to show what they had learned. To my surprise, some of them were able to create diagrams that showed a clear distinction between right and wrong.

I was proud of them for using their tools to learn and grow. And I knew that with time and practice, they would be able to tell the difference between right and wrong like adults.

作为一名老师，我总是想注意学生之间的差异。昨天，我正在教我们的孩子如何区分什么是对错。我发现有些孩子已经足够成熟了，能够理解这个概念，但是另一些孩子需要更多的时间来学习。

当我问他们关于什么是正确或错误的问题时，有些回答正确，而其他人说出了与我预期不同的东西。这时候，我突然意识到——我们的孩子和成人之间有一个巨大的差别，在道德方面的理解。让我意识到我们需要教会他们如何区分什么是对错。

所以今天，我决定使用老式工具，一张图表，来帮助他们更好地了解这个概念。然后我解释了它给他们，接着要求他们绘制自己的图表展示他们所学到的东西。令我惊讶的是，有些孩子能够创造出一幅图表明显区分对错。

我为他们用工具学习和成长而感到骄傲。并且，我知道在时间的流逝中，他们就像成人一样，能够区分什么是对错。
