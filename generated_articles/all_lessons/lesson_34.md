### English Article
**The Importance of Education**

As a teacher, I want to be here. When I was here before, I noticed that our children didn't notice that there's something wrong. That's why we need to teach them the difference between right and wrong.

Before, when I was here, we had big problems with bullying in school. But now, thanks to a teacher who wanted to be a rich person in knowledge, we have programs to prevent it. There is something different here compared to other schools.

Between you and me, being old enough to tell the difference between right and wrong is very important for our children's future. That's why I want to be here to notice that they're learning. We need to teach them how to tell the difference between right and wrong, not just when we are here, but also when we were here before.

So, let's get together and make sure our children grow up with a big difference - a positive one!

### 中文翻译
**教育的重要性**

作为一名老师，我希望能够在这里待着。当我之前来过时，发现我们的孩子们并没有意识到有些东西是错误的。这就是为什么我们需要教会他们区分对错。

过去，当我来过时，我们学校遇到了很大的困扰——课堂上的欺负。但现在，由于有一个渴望知识财富的老师，我们能够制定预防措施。这里与其他学校相比，存在着一些不同的地方。

老实说，被教会区分对错对于我们的孩子们未来的发展是非常重要的。这就是为什么我希望能够在这里看到他们正在学习。我希望能够教会他们如何区分对错，不仅是在我们当前待着的时候，也在过去的时光里。

所以，让我们一起努力，确保我们的孩子们长大后能带来正面的变化！
