**English Article**

As I was studying for my exam, I couldn't focus because of the noise in the library. (I) can't concentrate when it's too loud. My friend tried to call me on the phone number I gave her, but she said she couldn't hear me clearly. (She) didn't know my name at first, so I had to remind her. We decided to meet up later and finish our homework together.

When we met, she asked me why I was having trouble with a particular concept. I told her that I didn't understand it because of the way our teacher explained it in class. She suggested that we find an online resource to help us learn it better. After working on it together, I finally understood the material and felt confident for my exam.

当我们遇到时，她问我为什么会有困难理解特定概念。我告诉她，我无法理解它是因为我们的老师在课堂上解释它的方式。她的建议是让我们找到在线资源来帮助我们学习它更好。在与她合作工作后，我终于明白了材料并对我的考试感到自信。
