**My Daughter's New Project**

I am working on my daughter's homework. She needs to work on her project, which is due next week. We are working on a new project together. It's going to be fun! My daughter is looking for her toy, but she can't find it. I think we'll have to look for it again tomorrow.

Yesterday, my daughter was listening to music while she worked. She likes to listen carefully to the guitar in the background. If you listen carefully, you can hear a guitar playing softly. But if you don't listen carefully, you might not hear anything at all.

I am working on my daughter's homework with her. We are working together as a team. It's great that we can work together like this!
