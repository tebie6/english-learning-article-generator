### English Article:

"Meet Xingrong, a cheerful person who always wants to know if he is important. He believes that knowing oneself and recognizing one's own worth are vital steps towards personal growth. Importantly, Xingrong does not only focus on his strength but also acknowledges areas where improvement may be needed. 

Tod지, a friend of Xingrong, agrees with him completely. 'It is important to know if we are perfect,' he often says. They both like talking about these topics every day as they believe it helps them understand themselves and others better. But what does "perfect" mean? Is it being rich or healthy? Or perhaps something else entirely, Tzu pondered.

One day, Xingrong asked Jay Chou to join their discussion. 'You are important,' he told him sincerely. As the conversation progressed, they talked about their dreams and ambitions for tomorrow. They even debated whether it is possible to be perfect in today's world. In the end, they decided that everyone has something unique to offer - maybe being rich or healthy isn't as important as just being yourself."
