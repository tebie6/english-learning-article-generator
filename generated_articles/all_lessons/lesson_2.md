### English Article
**Title:** It's Good to Be Important!

**Subtitle:** A Conversation with Xingrong, Jay Chou, and Friends

As I sat down with my friend Xingrong the other day, we couldn't help but talk about what it means to be important. "It is good," Xingrong said with a smile. "You are important too." We both felt grateful for our friends who appreciate us.

Jay Chou, a renowned singer and songwriter, joined our conversation. "I am perfect," he claimed. But we all know that perfection is subjective. You are perfect in your own way, just like everyone else.

The discussion took an interesting turn when Jay asked, "You want to know if you are healthy?" I replied, "Yes, it's very important." Xingrong chimed in, "We have to know the truth."

As we continued our conversation, Jay mentioned that he likes to study and tell the truth every day. "It is possible," he said with a twinkle in his eye. Xingrong and I agreed, adding that it's good to be healthy and important too.

In conclusion, being important is not just about one's personal qualities; it's also about our relationships with others. As we all strive to be perfect in our own way, let's remember the importance of being kind, honest, and supportive towards each other.
