As I walked through the park, I realized how much I love to stay there every day. The fresh air and peaceful surroundings always leave me feeling relaxed. Last weekend, I talked with my friend who told me she wanted to change the world when she was young. Her determination inspired me to think about what changes I would make if given the chance. I've always dreamed of being a teacher, but never really thought about making any significant changes in the world. However, hearing her story made me want to join forces with her to create positive change. It's clear that we need people like her who are willing to work towards making the world a better place.
