### English Article

As I walked through the park, I saw a group of students working on their project. They were in the middle of finishing it up and seemed very focused. One of them was reading a book to get inspiration for their presentation. I watched as they took notes and asked each other questions to make sure they understood the material. Their teacher had given them a course on how to improve their public speaking skills, and they were putting it into practice.

After finishing their project, they decided to visit the Great Wall of China to see if they could relate their experience to what they learned in school. They took photos with friends and family members who joined them on this trip. One person wrote about his experiences on social media and shared it with everyone he knew. I was impressed by how much they had learned from this project and how well they worked together.
