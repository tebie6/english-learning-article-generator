### English Article
 
The old museum was once a famous landmark in town. However, it has been abandoned for many years. I visited the abandoned museum twice last year. Unfortunately, they haven't visited that museum before me. The most famous landmark in our city is still intact and attracts many tourists every year.

However, the new restaurant in town has become popular among locals and visitors alike. We tried their food once but haven't been back since then. My neighbor attended a yoga class last week. She hasn't finished writing her report on time, so she decided to attend another class to relax and get some inspiration. Meanwhile, my friend's window was broken by a strong gust of wind during the stormy weather.

Fortunately, he has fixed it already. In fact, he received an email from his colleague earlier that day, reminding him to finish his homework on time. I wish you could receive the same kind of reminder too!

### 中文翻译
 
那座老博物馆曾经是镇上闻名的标志性建筑。然而，它已经被废弃多年了。我去过两次废弃的博物馆，最后一次是在上年。不幸的是，他们以前没有人去过那座博物馆。我们的城市最著名的地标仍然完好无损，每年吸引着很多游客。

不过镇上的新餐厅却在当地民众和游客中迅速走红。我们尝试了他们的食物一次，但自从那以后就再也没回去过。我的邻居上周参加了一次瑜伽课。她还没有完成她交稿的报告，所以决定参加另一堂课放松一下，寻求灵感。与此同时，我朋友的窗户被暴风雨中的一阵强劲风打破了。

幸好他已经修好了。事实上，他收到了一封电子邮件从同事那边，提醒他在时间内完成作业。他希望你能收到同样的提醒!
