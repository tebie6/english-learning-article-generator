**English Article**

As Xingrong walked into the park, she felt very tired. She had been up late last night studying for her exam and was not feeling well today. "I have to sleep now," she said to herself. But just then, a bird flew in the sky, chirping happily. "Look, it wants to fly in the sky!" Xingrong exclaimed. However, it's impossible for a human to fly like that.

She sat down on a bench and pulled out her phone to read at home. Suddenly, she thought of an important reason why she liked to read at home - because she didn't have to worry about anything else. "I need to know it," she said to herself, thinking about what she had learned in school that day.

Just then, someone approached her and asked a question about the food she was eating. Xingrong explained that she loved to eat outside but today she needed to stay at home because of her tiredness. It turned out that her friend had been trying to convince her to go out with him, but Xingrong knew it wouldn't be possible for her.

当星荣走进公园时，她觉得非常累。昨晚她一直熬夜备考考试，今天也不好。 "我现在必须睡觉"，她对自己说。但刚好有一只鸟飞到天空里，啁啰着高兴地叫。她惊叹道： "看，它想在天空飞呀!" 然而人类却无法像那样飞起来。

她坐在一把椅子上，拿出手机准备回家看看。突然，她想起了一个重要的原因，为什么她喜欢宅在家里——因为她不用担心其他的事情。她对自己说： "我必须知道"，她在学校学到的知识让她想到今天的事。

恰巧有人走到她旁边问了一题关于她正在吃的食物。星荣解释说，她爱去外面吃，但今天她需要回家，因为她太累了。原来她的朋友一直想要劝说她出去，但星荣知道这不可能实现。
