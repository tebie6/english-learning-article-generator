**The Perfect Meeting Place**

Have you ever struggled to find a place that can hold all your friends? Yesterday, my friend Emily was planning a surprise party for her sister. She wanted to invite four people, but she couldn't decide on a room that could fit them comfortably. We went around the house looking for a suitable space.

First, we checked the living room, which is big enough, but it's not ideal for a surprise party. Then, we looked at the dining table, where ten people can sit and eat together. However, Emily wanted to hold a small meeting before the party to discuss some important details. We decided to use this room because it is big enough for our needs.

To make sure everything goes smoothly, Emily wants to decide on the menu in advance. She asked me if I could bring my knife to cut some fruits and veggies. Since she's planning to serve a variety of dishes, we need to hold a meeting tomorrow morning with all the party members present.

I'm excited for the party, and I'm sure it will be a success because we've planned everything carefully. Emily has chosen a suitable room that can fit everyone comfortably, and we'll have enough food for our guests.

###  **理想的聚会地点**

你是否曾经困难找到能容纳所有朋友的一个地方？昨天，我朋友艾米丽（Emily）正在计划为她姐姐-surprise Party。 她想要邀请四个人，但是却无法决定一个可以适合他们舒适地站着的地方。我们环绕家里寻找一个合适的空间。

首先，我们检查了客厅，它够大，但是并不是举行surprise Party 的理想场所。然后， 我们看了看餐桌，十个人的座位和吃东西一起可以在那里坐下。但是，艾米丽想要举行小型会议来讨论一些重要的事情。我们决定使用这个房间，因为它足够大来满足我们的需求。

为了确保一切顺利，艾米丽想要提前决定食物菜单。她请我把刀带过来，以便在切割水果和蔬菜的同时使用。但是，由于她准备了各种各样的菜肴，我们需要召开明天早上的会议，所有party成员都必须出席。

我对聚会感到兴奋，并且相信它将成功，因为我们已经小心地计划好了。艾米丽选择了一个足够大的地方可以容纳大家舒适地站着，食物也足够多来供应我们的客人。
