## English Article
As I walked home from school, I met an old friend. We were both eating eggs in the kitchen while she was watching her favorite videos. I love learning English by watching his videos, and he teaches us how to speak English. How cool is that? He's teaching us how to speak English by watching his videos, and we're all learning together. While we're learning English by watching videos, we also like to play the piano in the living room. She was playing the piano in the living room while I was sleeping in the bedroom when she called me to join her. It's great to have friends who share our interests and help us learn new things.
