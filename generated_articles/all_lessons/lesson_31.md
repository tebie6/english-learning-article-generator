### English Article

As I was getting ready for bed, my best friend asked me to make her a birthday cake. I decided to make it a special surprise by decorating the cake with colorful candles and writing "Happy Birthday" on top of it in icing letters. However, I soon realized that I had forgotten to buy some essential ingredients, so I quickly ran out to get them.

To my relief, I found everything I needed at the nearby store, including a beautiful toy car that my friend would love. As I was making the final touches on the cake, my friend asked me if she could make a video call to her friends who were away on holiday. I said yes and we spent the rest of the evening chatting with them.

The next morning, I decided to take some time off work to make up for not being able to attend their party the night before. My boss understood my situation and even offered me some advice on how to improve my decision-making skills. As I sat down at my desk, feeling grateful for my wonderful friends and supportive boss, I realized that sometimes life is full of unexpected changes and surprises.
