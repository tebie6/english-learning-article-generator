**English Article**

Xingrong was planning a surprise party for her friend's birthday. However, she didn't want to tell anyone the date or time because it wasn't important to reveal that information yet. She only needed to ask one person - her best friend, Ling - to bring some food and drinks. Xingrong told Ling to go shopping today, but not urgently, as they had plenty of time before the party tonight.

Ling was happy to help and wanted to know why this particular friend deserved such a special celebration. Xingrong explained that it was her friend's birthday, and she liked to make it a memorable occasion every year. She also mentioned that her friend didn't like big parties, so they had decided on a small gathering with close friends.

As the day went by, Ling finished shopping and asked Xingrong if she needed any help with decorations or setting up the party area. Xingrong replied that she would take care of those things, but thanked Ling for her willingness to help. In the end, everything was ready, and they all had a great time celebrating their friend's birthday.

星荣正在为她的朋友的生日做一个惊喜派对。然而，她不想告诉任何人生日的日期或时间，因为这不是很重要的信息。只有需要问一个人——她的好朋友，灵——带一些食物和饮料。她只告诉灵今天去购物，不急迫，因为他们有很多时间来准备派对今晚。

灵很高兴帮助，并想要知道为什么这个特殊的朋友值得如此特别的庆祝。星荣解释说，这是她的朋友生日，她喜欢每年为她做一个纪念性的聚会。她还提到她的朋友不喜欢大型派对，所以他们决定举办一场小型聚会。

天气渐渐转好，灵完成了购物，并问星荣是否需要帮助装饰或设置派对区域。星荣回复说她会处理这些事情，但感谢灵的愿意帮助。在最后，一切准备就绪，他们所有人都有一个很好的时间庆祝朋友的生日。
