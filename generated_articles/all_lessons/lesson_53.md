### English Article

Before I went on my dream trip to Paris, France last year, I had never been abroad. In fact, I hadn't even traveled to a foreign country before then. My parents arrived in Paris the day after I got there, and they were excited to see me. We decided to buy a house near the Eiffel Tower so we could stay together during our vacation.

We had saved enough money before we decided to buy the house, which made it possible for us to invest in the property without taking on too much debt. My parents planned their trip carefully and even invited some friends to join us for dinner at a quaint little restaurant nearby.

As I reflect on my time abroad, I realize that I had never driven a car before getting my driver's license. But while I was in Paris, my friends took me on a fun road trip through the countryside, where we enjoyed the scenic views and explored new places. It was definitely an unforgettable experience!

### 中文翻译

在我去往巴黎的梦幻之旅中，去年我第一次出国。事实上，我之前从未离开过中国。我的父母在到达巴黎那天就到了那里，他们很高兴见到我。我们决定在埃菲尔铁塔附近购买一栋房子，让我们三者都可以一起度假。

当我们决定购买房产时，我们已经储蓄了足够的钱，这使得我们不用负债太多就能投资于这栋房子。我的父母精心地规划了他们的行程，甚至邀请了一些朋友来和我们一起在附近的一家小餐馆聚会。

回想起我出国后的经历，我意识到我之前从未开过车，但是在巴黎期间，我的朋友带着我去乡下玩了一个趣味的旅程，我们欣赏到了风景和探索了新地方。这绝对是一个难忘的体验！
