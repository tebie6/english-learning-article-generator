### English Article

As I was looking for a new job, I couldn't help but think about how much I wanted to see my old colleagues again. I had been searching for weeks, and it seemed like everyone was either still looking or had already found something better. Just as I was starting to lose hope, I heard that my friend's company was hiring, and she suggested that we meet up for an interview.

I decided to look at their job posting online, but unfortunately, the person in charge of hiring wasn't available to meet until later that day. Feeling a bit frustrated, I couldn't help but think about how much I wanted to find my keys so I could go out and celebrate with my friends. Just then, my phone rang – it was the company! They were calling me back to confirm our meeting for later that afternoon.

Excited, I told them that I would be looking forward to seeing them, and we made plans to meet up in a few hours' time. As I hung up the phone, I couldn't help but feel optimistic about finding my dream job. After all, it's always good to hear positive news, especially when you're looking for something new.


### 中文翻译

在我寻找新的工作的过程中，我无法不想着重新见到旧同事们。几周过去了，似乎每个人都还是在寻找或已经找到了一份更好的工作。就在我开始失去希望的时候，我听说我的朋友的公司招聘了新员工，她建议我们约一面试。

我决定看看他们招聘的职位，但是很遗憾的是负责招聘的人无法安排相机时间见面。我有点沮丧，没办法就想着寻找我的钥匙，以便和朋友们一起庆祝。就在这时，我手机响了起来，它是公司打来的电话，他们确认我们下午的约会。

我感到高兴地告诉他们，我将期待着见到他们，我们决定在几小时后见面。我挂断电话，感觉很乐观找到了梦想工作。不管了，不要担心听到好的消息，尤其是在寻找新的工作。
