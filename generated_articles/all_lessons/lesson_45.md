### English Article
**A Day at the Beach**

Yesterday was a beautiful day, perfect for swimming in the sea before sunset. My father permits me to swim in the sea before sunset, so I spent the morning with my friends at the beach. We had a great time playing and laughing together.

After we got hungry, my father took us to buy some fish for lunch. On our way back, he told us that he stopped smoking for his health, and it's been three years now. He's really proud of himself, and so are we. My mother even started buying flowers for her friends as a gift.

Later in the day, my sister had a fight with her friend after they had an argument over something silly. My parents were worried about their relationship, but they made up before sunset.

As the sun began to set, I decided to go home on my way, and my dad reminded me that I needed to call my mom tomorrow for dinner plans. I remember calling you last night, and it was great catching up with each other. Anyway, I should probably stop buying flowers for her after they had a fight.

### 中文翻译
**在海边度过的一天**

昨天是个美好的日子，非常适合在夕阳前去海边游泳。父亲允许我和朋友们在海边玩耍，所以我们一大早就去了海边。我们度过了一整天的时间嬉戏、打闹。

到了中午，我们都饿得不行了，就让父亲带我们去买鱼吃 lunch。回来的路上，他告诉我们，三年前他为了健康而戒烟了，现在已经过去三年。他很骄傲，我们也都是这样。母亲甚至开始送花给她的朋友做礼物。

下午，我妹妹和她朋友发生了一次争执。这是因为她们之间的某件小事引起了口角。父母担心他们之间的关系，尽管如此，他们还是在夕阳之前和好如初。

当太阳渐渐西下时，我决定回家。父亲提醒我明天要给妈妈打电话，商量一下晚餐的事儿。我记得昨晚我给你打了个电话，我们聊了一整晚，也很开心。其实我不应该在他们之间的争执之后还送花给她们了。
