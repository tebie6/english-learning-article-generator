**Playing Basketball in High School**

I used to play basketball when I was in high school. It was a great time, and I enjoyed playing with my friends every day after school. We would go to the basketball court, which was located near our school, and practice our shots until the sun went down.

In fact, I loved playing basketball so much that I used to play every morning before going to class. My friends would often tease me for being a kid who played too much, but I didn't care – I just wanted to improve my game. Those were the days when I was young and full of energy.

But as time passed, I started to lose interest in playing basketball. I began to watch cartoons every morning instead, and soon I found myself not even watching them anymore! It's funny how life can change so quickly.

Looking back, I'm glad I had those experiences playing basketball in high school. They taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance – skills that have helped me throughout my life. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll pick up a ball again and get back to my old tricks!

### 中文翻译
**高中时期的篮球生活**

我曾经在高中时学习篮球。那个时候非常开心，每天放学后都会和朋友们一起去篮球场练习射球直到夕阳西下。

事实上，我很喜欢篮球，所以每天早上都要去篮球场训练。当时的我充满了精力，我的朋友经常嘲笑我“太爱玩了”，但我并不在意。我只是想提高自己的篮球水平。这些是年轻、充满活力的日子。

但是随着时间的推移，我对篮球的兴趣逐渐消失了，我开始每天早上看动画片，后来我甚至都不再看它们了！生活真奇妙！

回想起来，我很高兴有过在高中时期学习篮球的经历。这些经历教会了我团队精神、纪律和毅力等重要技能，这些技能一直帮助着我一生。

谁知道呢？也许有一天我又会拿起篮球，重新开始以前的练习！
