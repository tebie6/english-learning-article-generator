**English Article**

As I look back on my life, I remember playing basketball in high school. It was a sport I loved and enjoyed every moment of it. However, after graduation, I decided to focus more on my studies and less on sports. But sometimes, when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed, I like to watch cartoons from my childhood days. There's something about those colorful characters that brings me back to a simpler time.

I used to drink coffee every morning, but now I prefer tea. It's not as strong, but it suits my taste better. My old job was at a company where we had a team of smokers in the break room. As much as they tried to quit, they always seemed like strangers to me. But one day, one of them became a close friend, and that changed everything.

Now, I work for a different company, and I'm more focused on my job than ever before. It's a challenge, but it's also rewarding in its own way. Maybe someday, I'll be able to look back on my life and say, "Ah, yes, I was a smoker, but now I'm a non-smoker." Until then, I'll just keep moving forward.
