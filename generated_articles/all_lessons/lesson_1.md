### English Article

As I sat down for lunch, I realized that I had forgotten my favorite food at home. "I need to eat the food," I thought to myself. So, I decided to go back home and have it with me. But then I remembered that I had promised to meet a friend at the park later in the day. "It is possible to see you later," I told him. However, I felt that it was not very important for me to keep the promise since we could just catch up another time.

Feeling hungry, I quickly finished my lunch and headed back home to eat the food that I had brought with me. It was delicious! After eating, I realized that I still had some time before meeting my friend again. "I like to do it now," I thought, so I decided to take a short walk around the block while enjoying the beautiful day. As I walked, I couldn't help but think about how happy I was to have such wonderful friends and tasty food in my life.

### 中文翻译

当我坐下吃午餐时，我意识到自己把最喜欢的食物忘在家里了。"我需要吃这个食物"，我想着告诉自己去回家带上它。然后我记起还有一个朋友约我今天中午在公园见面。"可以看到你以后再说吧" 我跟他说。但是，我觉得这并不是特别重要，因为我们以后有更多机会相见。

吃饱了感觉饿了，我马上回到家吃带回来的食物，好极了! 吃完后我意识到还有些时间再去公园看朋友。"现在还是可以做的" 我告诉自己，所以决定在这段时间里散步一圈享受美好的日子。走着走着，我就想到有这么多好朋友和好吃的食物真幸福!
