**English Article**

It's tomorrow, and it's Xiaoyueliang's birthday. I'm so excited to make her happy. Last week, I bought her a big surprise - a new dress! She was thrilled when she opened the gift. I also made her a cup of coffee in the morning every day last week, hoping that she would feel happy and energized.

I plan to buy her another birthday gift next month. This time, it's going to be something special, a handmade craft that shows how much I care about her. I'm sure she will love it, and it will make her feel even more loved on her special day.

When you come home tomorrow, don't forget to call me! I'll be waiting for you, ready to celebrate Xiaoyueliang's birthday with you both. We can read a bedtime story together, just like we did last week, and make this day truly unforgettable.

明天是Xiaoyueliang的生日，我非常期待让她高兴。上周，我给了她一个大惊喜——一件新裙子！当她打开礼物时，她的脸上都是喜色。我还每天早晨给她煮了杯咖啡，希望她会感到高兴和精力充沛。

我计划在下个月再给她买生日礼物。这次要是件特别的东西——一件手工艺品，展示出我对她的关爱。肯定她会喜欢，它还会让她在这个特殊的日子里更感到被爱。

当你回家时，不要忘记给我打电话！明天，我等着你们庆祝Xiaoyueliang生日吧。当你回家后，我们一起读故事，就像我们上周一样，创造出一个令人难忘的夜晚。
