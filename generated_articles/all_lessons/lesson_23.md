**English Article**

It was a sunny day at school, and Emma wanted to hand her friend Mike his favorite book. But Mike was busy on the phone and couldn't take it from her. So, Emma decided to ask him to hang up and take the book instead.

"Mike, can you please hang up your phone?" Emma asked politely. "I want you to hand me your school bag so I can get my phone out."

Mike nodded and quickly handed over his backpack. Emma took out her phone and started texting her mom. Mike then took the book from Emma and put it in his bag.

"Thanks, Emma!" he said with a smile. "Now, can you please give me back my phone?"

Emma laughed and handed him his phone. "Of course, I want you to have your phone back," she replied.

As they walked to their next class, Mike turned to Emma and asked, "Do you need anything from the cafeteria?"

"No, I'm good," Emma said. "But can you please hand me a banana on your way there? I'm starving!"

Mike chuckled and handed her a banana. "Here you go! Enjoy it."

在学校里，艾玛想把她朋友迈克的最爱书交给他。但是迈克正在打电话，无法接过。所以，艾玛决定让他挂起电话，然后取书。

"迈克，请你挂掉你的手机!"艾玛恭切地问道。“我想要你把学校包交给我，以便我从里边拿出我的手机。”

迈克点了头，然后迅速把背包递给艾玛。后者抽出了她的手机开始打短信。

"谢谢，艾玛!" 迈克说着笑意盎然的表情。“现在，请你把我的手机还给我吧!”

艾玛一笑，接着把迈克的手机交了回去。“当然，你应该拥有你的手机。”她回答道。

他们随后一起步向下一个班级。途中，迈克问道：“你需要什么东西从咖啡厅吗？”


艾玛回答说：“不，我已经满足了。”但是接着又补充了一句，“但请你把香蕉放在你的袋子里吧！我好饿啊！”


迈克乐不可支地接着笑着，塞进了一个香蕉。“给你享用吧!”
