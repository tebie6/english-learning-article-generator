**Helping Hands at School**

Yesterday, I was in a bit of trouble. I had forgotten my school bag at home, and I really needed to get to class on time. Luckily, my friend Emma was kind enough to lend me her phone so that I could call my mom to pick up the bag. She even offered to hand it over to me when she got to school.

I felt really grateful for Emma's help, especially since she had a lot of work to do herself. As we walked into class together, I wanted to say thank you in a special way. So, I asked her if she could hand me my school bag, and she smiled and said yes.

It was such a relief to have my bag back, and it made me think about how helpful it is to have friends like Emma who are always willing to lend a hand. In fact, I remember last week when she handed me a banana that I had forgotten in her bag. It's moments like those that make me appreciate the kindness of others.

As we took our seats in class, our teacher asked us if anyone needed help with anything. And you know what? Emma and I were both thinking... "Can you please hand me my school bag?" but we just smiled at each other because we already had it sorted out!

**学校里的帮助之手**

昨天，我遇到了一点麻烦。我把书包忘了在家里，急需提前上课。幸好，我的朋友艾玛（Emma）很友善地借给我她的手机，让我打电话给妈妈去取书包。她甚至还同意将书包交给她到了学校。

当时，我真的很感激艾玛的帮助，特别是考虑到她自己的作业工作量那么大。我们一起走进教室时，我想对她表达一点特别的感谢。我问她能不能将书包递给我，她微笑着回答：“当然可以。” 

拿到书包后我感觉真的是一份大救星，于是我突然想到有朋友像艾玛这样的很有帮助。之前有一周，她把我忘在书包里的香蕉还给了我。这类小事让我知道人们之间的善良行为很重要。

我们走进教室的时候，老师问谁需要帮助，我们两个同时想到了... "能不能帮忙递给我书包?" 但我们只是对着彼此笑了一下，因为我们已经解决了问题。
