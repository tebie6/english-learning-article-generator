### English Article

The driver admitted running a red light, which is a serious traffic offense. He claimed he was in a rush to get to the meeting on time, but the police officer didn't buy it.

He tried to avoid talking about the incident, but eventually admitted telling a white lie to avoid hurting someone's feelings.
