**Teaching Children to Tell Right from Wrong**

As a teacher, I want our children to grow up with good values and morals. We need to teach them the difference between right and wrong from a young age. When they are old enough, we can start explaining why certain actions are considered wrong, such as hurting someone's feelings or taking something that doesn't belong to us.

I notice that many times, children don't understand what is right and wrong. They might see their friends doing something bad and think it's okay because their friends did it. However, this is not the case. We need to teach them that just because everyone else is doing something, it doesn't make it right.

There is a big difference between right and wrong. When I was teaching my own children, I made sure they understood that there are consequences for our actions. If we do something bad, we have to face the music and apologize or fix what we broke. This helps them develop a sense of responsibility and respect for others' feelings.

As parents, it's our job to teach our children how to tell right from wrong. We can start by setting a good example ourselves and having open conversations with them about important issues. By doing so, we can raise well-rounded individuals who will grow up to be caring and responsible members of society.

### 中文翻译
**教孩子分辨是非**

作为一名老师，我希望我们的孩子长大后能够拥有好的价值观和道德。我们需要从小就教他们做什么是对的，做什么是错的。当他们老一点，我们可以开始解释为什么某些行为被认为是不正确的，比如伤害别人的感受或抢走不属于自己的东西。

我注意到很多时候，孩子们不知道什么是对的，什么是错的。他们可能看到朋友们做了坏事，但是觉得好玩，因此也去干了。然而，这并不是真的。我们需要教会他们，即使所有人都在做某件事情，它并不一定都是正确的。

正确和错误之间有着巨大的差别。当我教导我的孩子时，我保证他们了解我们的行为将带来什么后果。如果我们做了坏事，我们必须面对后果，并向受害者道歉或修复破坏的东西。这能帮助他们培养责任感和尊严感。

作为父母，我们有责任教会我们的孩子如何分辨是非。我们可以从给他们一个好的榜样开始，并与他们开诚布公地讨论重要的问题。这样，我们就能培养出有同情心、负责的个人，让他们成长为社会的一员。
