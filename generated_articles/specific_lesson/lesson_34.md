## English Article
As a teacher, I want to be here and help our children learn. But first, we need to notice that there is something wrong with the way they are taught. When I was a student, I didn't know the difference between right and wrong, but now I want to teach them how to tell the difference. My students are old enough to understand, so let's start by teaching them about the importance of knowing what is right and wrong.

We can begin by using real-life examples, like the difference between a weapon and a tool. It's not just about being big or small, but about understanding the consequences of our actions. As their teacher, I want to be there for them, guiding them through this process. We all know that we have to be aware of the world around us, so let's make sure they learn how to notice and understand what is right and wrong.
